		description:
			'This study presents a University Navigation System with TensorFlowLite for building recognition. Hardware used by the system includes a camera, speakers, and an HP monitor. Using Roboflow, researchers integrate an Object detection model into a mobile app developed in Android Studio using Flutter IDE. Tensorflow Lite is used to train the detection model, while JupyterLab is used for model training and testing. The app is installed on Android devices and Kiosks. It provides pathfinding, estimated journey time, and voice messages. A responsive path generator finds optimal routes. Tapping the book icon on the mini map displays building info, including offices. This system benefits University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines Cagayan de Oro Campus, aiding navigation for students and visitors.',
